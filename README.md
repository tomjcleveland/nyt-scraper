# nyt-scraper

A simple script for storing New York Times headlines in a database, so I can run some analysis on A/B testing.

## Inspecting the data

To find articles with multiple headlines, try:

```
$ psql -h nyt-headlines.cbyvknksdshk.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres -d nyt -c "SELECT id,COUNT(DISTINCT headline) FROM nyt.headlines GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;"
```
